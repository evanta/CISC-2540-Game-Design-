This project is an expansion of the Godot tools we've gone over in class. 
I've added a main scene which is the background of grass and sky.
I also have a few additional scenes which are the two trees and the rock. 
This project was good for learning Godot, but also setting up GitHub which should 
make future submissions much easier.
